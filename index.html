        <h3>Idea</h3>

<p>We want to make an alternate interface for controlling smartphones. It's annoying having to take the phone out of the pocket for every little thing. We want to make it possible to perform simple predetermined actions on the phone by simply tapping the phone while it's in the pocket. </p>

<p>TEST</p>

<p>Use-cases where it's nice to not have to take out the phone:</p>

<ul>
<li>While in meeting: silencing a ringing phone or sending a predetermined message<br>
</li>
<li>Start recording sound</li>
<li>Control music apps</li>
<li>Control a stop watch</li>
<li>For any use when it's inappropriate to be using the phone</li>
</ul><h3>Goal</h3>

<p>At the end of this project we want an interface which is reliable enough for everyday use and we will have two example applications using this interface. The project must be done and ready for presentation by March 16. when at least one example app will be presented to our class.</p>

<p>The first app will be a distance measuring app for golf, two taps for marking the start GPS location for where the shot was taken from, and then three taps for marking where the ball landed. The app will then read back to the user the distance the ball has traveled.</p>

<p>The second app will be an app for controlling media-playback in smartphones. It will be possible to stop, pause or go to next song by tapping the phone. Should ideally work for most music playing applications like the built in player, Spotify, Pandora etc.</p>

<h3>Main technical challenges</h3>

<ul>
<li>Properly reading user input</li>
<li>Giving feedback to the user</li>
<li>Making this happen while the phone is in a locked state</li>
<li>Creating an interface which is reliable enough</li>
</ul><h3>Solutions to some of the technical challenges</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fusing accelerometer and sound recording to detect the signature of a tap to the side of the phone (maybe also gyroscope)</li>
<li>Launching the app as a service to make it run in background and during lock state</li>
<li>Feedback via text-to-speech, vibration or simple sounds </li>
</ul><h3>Progress</h3>

<p>The project has been presented to the class and our professor has accepted it.</p>

<p>Homepage is up</p>

<p>We have determined some of the most important challenges and modules in our project and divided them between us. </p>

<p>Programmed several simple apps for testing and getting used to: accelerometer, microphone, vibration motor, text-to-speech, controlling media apps etc.</p>

<p>Started looking at what kind of data we can get from the accelerometer and microphone and ways to analyze these.</p>

<p>To be continued...</p>
